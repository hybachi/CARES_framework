# CARES Framework

**Capability-Aware Resilient Emergency Swarms (CARES)** is a thesis project focused on the design and implementation of a capability-aware, decentralized, and resilient heterogeneous swarm framework for **Urban Search and Rescue (USAR)** scenarios.

The project investigates how heterogeneous robots with differing capabilities can autonomously coordinate, adapt to failures, and continue operating under uncertain communication conditions, without relying on centralized control.
